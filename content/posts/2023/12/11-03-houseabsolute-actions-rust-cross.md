## Release notes

- Fixed handling of crates with multiple binaries. Attempting to strip binaries for such a crate caused the build to fail. Reported by Toma≈æ Hribernik. GH #8
- Added a new `cross-version` parameter. This can be specified to make this action use a specific version of `cross`. If this is not specified, the latest version will be used.
