## What's Changed
This adds a series of Dependabot updates for various dependencies and introduces a new tagging strategy. Similar to how many of the GitHub created actions work, you can now pin to the major, major/minor, or full semantic version of this action. This will allow consumers to determine how they wish to receive updates as this repository follows the semantic versions specifications as defined at https://semver.org/.
