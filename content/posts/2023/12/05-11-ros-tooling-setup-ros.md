## Release notes

* Pin version of empy to <4 (backport https://github.com/ros-tooling/setup-ros/pull/632)

Please note that we didn't plan to keep supporting `setup-ros` for EOL distros. `v0.7` drops support for Foxy, but this release fixes workflows for Foxy with `v0.6`, since Foxy has only been EOL for 6 months.
