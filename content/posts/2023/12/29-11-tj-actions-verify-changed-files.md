## Release notes

# Changes in v17.0.0
## ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ BREAKING CHANGE ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ 
A new `safe_output` input is now available to prevent outputting unsafe filename characters (Enabled by default). This would escape characters in the filename that could be used for command injection.

> [!NOTE]
> This can be disabled by setting the `safe_output` to false this comes with a recommendation to store all outputs generated in an environment variable first before using them.

#### Example
```yaml
...
      - name: Verify Changed files
        uses: tj-actions/verify-changed-files@v16
        id: verify-changed-files
        with:
          safe_output: false # set to false because we are using an environment variable to store the output and avoid command injection.
      
      - name: List all changed tracked and untracked files
        env:
          FILES_CHANGED: ${{ steps.verify-changed-files.outputs.changed_files }}
        run: |
          echo "Changed files: $FILES_CHANGED
...
```
