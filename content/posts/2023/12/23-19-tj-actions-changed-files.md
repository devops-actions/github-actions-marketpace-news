## Release notes

# Changes in v41.0.0
## ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ BREAKING CHANGE ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ 
A new `safe_output` input is now available to prevent outputting unsafe filename characters (Enabled by default). This would escape characters in the filename that could be used for command injection.

> [!NOTE]
> This can be disabled by setting the `safe_output` to false with the recommendation to store all outputs generated in an environment variable first before using them.

#### Example
```yaml
...
    - name: Get changed files
      id: changed-files
      uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v40
      with:
        safe_output: false # set to false because we are using an environment variable to store the output and avoid command injection.

    - name: List all added files
      env:
        ADDED_FILES: ${{ steps.changed-files.outputs.added_files }}
      run: |
        for file in "$ADDED_FILES"; do
          echo "$file was added"
        done
...
```
