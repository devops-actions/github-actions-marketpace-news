## Release notes

This GitHub Action scans your public-facing web application for API keys, secrets, cloud misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities in the application itself. This analysis is best run AFTER you have deployed to your new test, staging or prod public endpoint. With each iteration of this analysis, you will gain insight into the state of the application and SecureStack will let you know if you just deployed something that isn't secure!
