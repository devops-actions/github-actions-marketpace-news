## Release notes

App Crawler Actions for android allows users to leverage Android Jetpack Robo Test , that will `run alongside your app, automatically issuing actions (tap, swipe, etc.) to explore the state-space of your app. The crawl terminates automatically when there are no more unique actions to perform, the app crashes, or a timeout you designate is reached.`
