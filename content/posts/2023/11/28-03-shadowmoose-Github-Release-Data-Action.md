Version updated for **shadowmoose/Github-Release-Data-Action** to version **4.0.0**.
- This action is used across all versions by **5** repositories.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-attachment-metadata) to find the latest changes.

## Release notes

This is a major shift in functionality, which brings automatic branch building and file deployment to this Action. It also changes the file format to use an array, so that a preset limit of Release History can be served to clients. 

The 4.x versions of this Action will be entirely incompatible with 3.x, so don't upgrade unless you need this different functionality.
