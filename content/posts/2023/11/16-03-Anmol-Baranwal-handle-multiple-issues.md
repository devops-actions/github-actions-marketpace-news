## Release notes

## Enhancements to Workflow Flexibility and Documentation

Hi everyone! ðŸŽ‰ In this release, I've implemented the following updates:

- Introduced the `assign` option to filter issues assigned to the author. This functionality is active only when `issueNumber` is set to `true`.

- Modified the default value of `issueNumber` to `true` for improved usability.

- Added the option to apply multiple labels simultaneously using syntax mentioned in the documentation.

- Enhanced user flexibility by making the `GitHub token` field optional, removing the mandatory requirement.

- Included examples and updated documentation to illustrate all possible scenarios.

These changes aim to streamline workflow management and provide more customization options for your open source management. 
Thank you for your continued support! ðŸš€
