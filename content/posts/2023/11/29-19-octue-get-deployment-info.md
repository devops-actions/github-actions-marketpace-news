## Release notes

# Summary
This pull request does two main things:
1. It distinguishes between the version specified in the `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` file and the revision tag:
  - The `version_slug` output is now the slugified form of `version` instead of the slugified form of the revision tag
  - The old form of `version_slug` is now `revision_tag_slug` 
  - A non-slugified `revision_tag` output is now available
2. The `revision_tag` of a non-main branch is now `branch-<branch-name>` instead of `unreleased`. This facilitates having multiple deployed branches.
