## Release notes

# Create Status Check

This GitHub Action allows creating or updating a Status Check as a job in a GitHub Actions Workflow.

> **Note**
>
> This action was forked from [Sibz/github-status-action](https://github.com/Sibz/github-status-action) which has not been updated in 2+ years. Rather than create another PR, I forked it to a new action, updated all dependencies and restored build tests.
