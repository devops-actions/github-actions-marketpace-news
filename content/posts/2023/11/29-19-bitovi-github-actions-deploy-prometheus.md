## Release notes

Ever want to spin up your own time series database to track arbitrary things over time?


# OMG, ME TOO!  ðŸ¥³ 


I'm excited to announce this new action to deploy Prometheus and Grafana!

Simply provide your cloud credentials (AWS supported initially, others to come), and start scraping metrics for your GitHub activity, for your home automation system, or even your company financial health with your own cloud hosted Prometheus Instance!

> Once deployed, Visualize the metrics in the Prometheus UI itself (port `:443`) or visualize via Grafana (port `:3000`).
