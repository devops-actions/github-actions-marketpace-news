## Release notes

We've made several exciting updates to the FTP Transfer Action project to enhance its functionality, security, and user-friendliness:

Enhanced Security: The action.yml now enforces SSL encryption by default, aligning with best practices to ensure secure file transfers. We’ve also emphasized the use of GitHub Secrets to protect your credentials, providing a safer and more reliable experience.

Improved Usability: With updated input descriptions in the action.yml, users can now better understand how to configure the action for their specific needs. We've also added more examples to the documentation, making it easier for users to get started.

Modernized Infrastructure: The Dockerfile has been optimized to reduce image size and improve build times, while also increasing security by running the action as a non-root user.

Streamlined Execution: The entrypoint.sh script now includes robust error handling and input validation, ensuring that the action fails gracefully and provides meaningful error messages to help with troubleshooting.

Updated Documentation: The README.md has been thoroughly revised to include a detailed explanation of input parameters, security best practices, sample workflows, and a comprehensive guide for contributing to the project.

New Logo: A modern, trust-evoking logo has been designed, reflecting the core features of the FTP Transfer Action — security, reliability, and efficiency.

These updates aim to not only provide a more secure and user-friendly tool but also to foster community involvement and collaboration on the project's ongoing development.
