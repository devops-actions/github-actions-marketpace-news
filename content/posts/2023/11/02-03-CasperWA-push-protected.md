## Release notes

# Extend inputs & support GH Enterprise

GH Enterprise is supported by using a variable base URL for GH and the GH REST API.

**New inputs**:
- `acceptable_conclusions`: Conclusion states that will not result in errors and a failure.
- `fail_fast`: Toggle failing as soon as a status check concludes in a state not part of `acceptable_conclusions`.
- `gh_rest_api_base_url`: The GH REST API base URL, defaults to `https://api.github.com`. For more information about this value, see [the GH docs]([here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/quickstart?apiVersion=2022-11-28&tool=curl#using-curl-commands-in-github-actions)).
- `post_sleep`: Set the seconds the action should sleep after waiting for status checks to conclude.

**Changed inputs**:
- `pre_sleep`: Renamed input for the old `sleep` input.
- `sleep`: Deprecated. It is now called `pre_sleep` instead.
