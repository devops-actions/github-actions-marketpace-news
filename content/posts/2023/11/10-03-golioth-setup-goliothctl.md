## Release notes

This is the initial release of the GitHub Action for `goliothctl`, the Golioth CLI. We've been testing internally to automate our firmware development and release process. We believe it is also useful for users in their own automation workflow. We'd love feedback! Open an issue or discuss at https://forum.golioth.io/.
