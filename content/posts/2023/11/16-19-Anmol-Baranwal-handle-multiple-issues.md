## Release notes

## Ignore Specified Users & Collaborators

Hi everyone! ðŸŽ‰ In this release, I've incorporated the following enhancements:

- Introduced the `ignoreUsers` option, allowing you to specify usernames for exclusion from this workflow.

- Implemented the `ignoreCollaborators` option to automatically ignore all repository collaborators during workflow execution.

- Included examples and updated documentation to illustrate both options.

_Thank you for your continued support! ðŸš€_
