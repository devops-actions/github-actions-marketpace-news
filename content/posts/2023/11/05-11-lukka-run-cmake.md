## Release notes

Changes:
  - Update the action to require node v20, since v16 is out of support. If any problem occurs, please use `run-cmake@v10.6`and create an issue.
  - Update dependencies to most recent ones: all libs and `@actions` packages update to most recent versions, along with all other dependencies.
  - Drop usage of gulp.
  - Update docs.
 
Note: to keep your workflow up to date with bug and security fixes, just use `v10` branch to stay on the most recent `v10.x` version of this action, e.g., `uses: lukka/run-cmake@v10`
