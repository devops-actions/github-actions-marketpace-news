## Release notes

### Checkmarx support  
Connect Checkmarx that is integrated with your CI/CD pipelines to DevOps Change Velocity to retrieve security scan results. This helps you determine how vulnerable your code is. Checkmarx scans that are configured on GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and Azure DevOps pipelines are supported in the base system. You can view the security scan results either in the related list of a Change Request or the Task Execution of the pipeline in your ServiceNow instance or in the Pipeline UI. You can use security results in defining change policies and conditions for change automation. Both Checkmarx One and Checkmarx SAST are supported.
