## Release notes

Add typings for [github-actions-typing](https://github.com/typesafegithub/github-actions-typing)

In order to [qualify](https://typesafegithub.github.io/github-workflows-kt/user-guide/using-actions/#requirements-for-adding-a-new-action) for inclusion in [github-workflows-kt](https://github.com/typesafegithub/github-workflows-kt), the tagging scheme has changed to include a patch version (`v1.y.z`). 

Previous tags `v1.1` and `v1.2` are kept in order to not break existing references but should be considered deprecated.

Previous tag `v1` is now a branch that points to the latest `v1.y.z` (currently `v1.3.0`) as [recommended by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions#using-tags-for-release-management). If your worflows depended on `v1`, they will now use tag `v1.3.0` instead of `v1.0.0` previously
