## Release notes

## What's Changed
* `public_base_path` parameter/input default value is resolved based on the existence of CNAME (for GitHub pages custom domain configuration) primarily, with a fallback repository name if CNAME is not found as last resort.
* Backward compatible with previous versions and installations. It should work as is.
* Custom domain expansion proposition made by @gregsadetsky in https://github.com/skywarth/vite-github-pages-deployer/issues/5
* Custom domain expansion developed by @skywarth in https://github.com/skywarth/vite-github-pages-deployer/pull/7
