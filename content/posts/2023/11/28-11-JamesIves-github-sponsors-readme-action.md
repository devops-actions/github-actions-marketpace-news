Version updated for **JamesIves/github-sponsors-readme-action** to version **v1.3.0**.
- This action is used across all versions by **7** repositories.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/add-github-sponsors-to-readme) to find the latest changes.

## Release notes

## What's Changed
* The action is now developed against Node 20.
* The `sponsorship-status` output has been renamed to `sponsorshipStatus` to comply with best practices. **This has the potential to break some workflows, but it is unlikely as the way this variable was named previously makes it difficult to interface with. As such as this has not been marked as a breaking change, I apologize if this theory ends up being inaccurate.**
* Fixes an issue where if for some reason `monthlyPriceInCents` is undefined, we set the value to `0`. 
* Add note for organisation usage by @0xTim in https://github.com/JamesIves/github-sponsors-readme-action/pull/538
