## Release notes

Minor release with some changes and fixes:

* All `rustfmt` suggestions are now included in the job summary report. This helps if there are more than 10 annotations to add to a PR, because GitHub currently limits this to 10 (a note about this limitation has been added to the readme).
* If `rustfmt` has suggestions, the action will fail, allowing it to be used to detect unformatted code in a CI process. (This is a bugfix as that was the original intended behavior ðŸ˜…)
