## Release notes

DocFX Unity package is a GitHub action for deploying a DocFX website for Unity packages to GitHub Pages.

Full Changelog: https://github.com/CaseyHofland/docfx-unitypackage/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

This release fixes an error that would occur if one of the following files was not present:

- Documentation~/config.json
- Documentation~/projectMetadata.json

This error was triggered by an update to docfx. The good news is that now projectMetadata.json actually works. Jay!
