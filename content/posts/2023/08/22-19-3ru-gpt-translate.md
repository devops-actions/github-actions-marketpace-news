## Release notes

## Experimental Delayed Translation

OpenAI has[ strict rate limits for GPT-4](https://platform.openai.com/account/rate-limits).
This release will tentatively address the issue by adding a delay.


(I made a mistake in naming the version, but since there is no problem, I will leave it as it is.)
