## Release notes

_Binstall is a tool to fetch and install Rust-based executables as binaries. It aims to be a drop-in replacement for `cargo install` in most cases. Install it today with `cargo install cargo-binstall`, from the binaries below, or if you already have it, upgrade with `cargo binstall cargo-binstall`._

#### In this release:

- Remove GitHub token format check as it sometimes rejects valid GitHub tokens (#1415 #1416)
