- This action is used across all versions by **43** repositories.

## Release notes

This release has the parsing code moved to Nuitka and no longer contains as many details. However, new options of Nuitka will still require newer versions of this action to use those options, since currently only known (to the action) options are usable. It might be advisable to just use `main` even though that can of course break.
