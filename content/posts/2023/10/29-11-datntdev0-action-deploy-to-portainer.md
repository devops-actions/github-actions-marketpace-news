## Release notes

We are thrilled to announce the release of our new GitHub Action, which introduces automated deployment and unit testing features.

**Key Features:**

1. **Automated Deployment:** With this release, you can now deploy Docker Compose files to a Portainer stack directly from your GitHub repository. This feature leverages GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistent deployments.
2. **Unit Testing:** To ensure the reliability and effectiveness of our deployment feature, we have incorporated unit tests in this release. These tests help us maintain high-quality code by catching issues early in the development cycle.

This release marks a significant milestone in our projectâ€™s journey. We believe these features will greatly enhance your productivity and streamline your deployment process. As always, we look forward to your feedback and suggestions for future improvements.

Thank you for your continued support!
