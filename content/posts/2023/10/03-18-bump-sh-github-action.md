## Release notes

This is a bugfix release which contains a fix to be able to send AsyncAPI 2.6.0 definition files. There was a bug in the JS dependency tree from the `bump-cli` package which led to inconsistent node packages.

With this release the bug is gone! ðŸ˜Œ

Have fun with AsyncAPI âœ¨
