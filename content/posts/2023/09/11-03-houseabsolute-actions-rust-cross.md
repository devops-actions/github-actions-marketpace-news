## Release notes

- Added a `working-directory` parameter. By default this is the current directory (`.`) but you can set it to something else to compile a single crate or workspace in a subdirectory of the repo. This allows you to use this action with monorepos with multiple crates. Based on GH #7 by @aaronvg.
