## Release notes

**Prevent insecure dependencies before they can merge. Track and remediate vulnerabilities in your entire supply chain.**

EdgeBit is a [real-time SCA tool](https://edgebit.io/solutions/vulnerability-management/?utm_source=github) that uses data about how your app executes in production to filter out irrelevant vulnerabilities and dormant code.

This release uploads an SBOM to EdgeBit for analysis and optionally returns results:
 - as a Pull Request check through the EdgeBit GitHub app
 - as a comment from the action on a Pull Request
