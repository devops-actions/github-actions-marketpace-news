## Release notes

## üöÄ Release Notes for Repodex-Sarif-Solver

### üõ°Ô∏è CodeQL Security Scan & Auto-Fix Integration

With this release, our repository now boasts an automated security scanning mechanism using CodeQL. But that's not all! After identifying vulnerabilities, the system communicates with Repodex to fetch potential solutions. 

### üåü Features

1. **Automated Security Scanning with CodeQL**
   - Scans the codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
   - Ensures that our code adheres to the best security practices.

2. **Integration with Repodex**
   - After scanning, the system sends identified vulnerabilities to Repodex.
   - Repodex processes the vulnerabilities and returns potential fixes.

3. **Automated Pull Requests**
   - Once solutions are fetched from Repodex, an automated pull request is created.
   - This PR contains the suggested fixes, streamlining the process of securing our codebase.

### üìã How to Use

1. **Triggering the Scan**
   - As configured by your `workflow.yaml`
   - - see example below that triggers on push to main branch

2. **Reviewing Solutions**
   - After the scan, check the automated pull request.
   - Review the suggested fixes from Repodex.
   - Merge the PR if the solutions are satisfactory.

### üôè Acknowledgements

We'd like to thank the teams behind CodeQL and Repodex for their fantastic tools, making automated security checks and fixes a reality.
