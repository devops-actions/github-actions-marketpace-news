## Release notes

Create CloudFormation templates for your Open API Spec!

For your **API key** enabled APIs, you can now automatically generate:

* EventBridge rules that call your endpoints
* EventBridge API destinations for all your endpoints

This allows you to fire and forget calls to your API as you process lengthy jobs.
