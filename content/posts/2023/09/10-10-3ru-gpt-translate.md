## Release notes

# Improved input file specification method

Input file specification can now also be a directory, as shown below.
```sh
/gpt-translate website/**/*.md website/**/*.ja.md Japanese
```
This command translates all `md` files under the `website/` directory as `.ja.md`.

<br/>

[tips] ðŸ‘†In this case, we can make our output file specification concise.
```sh
/gpt-translate website/**/*.md **/*.ja.md Japanese
```

<br/>

The `glob` library is used to search for files. 
For details, please check the[ `glob` repository](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob).
