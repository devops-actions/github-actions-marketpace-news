## Release notes

Added by @potiuk 

> Removing label when you lost or never had an approval status
> might not be what you desire to do. In some workflows when
> the label is manually set, removing it is automatically is
> harmful and it's better to leave the decision about removal
> to the commiters.
> 
> Adding the parameter solves the problem.

Thanks @potiuk 👏 🚀
