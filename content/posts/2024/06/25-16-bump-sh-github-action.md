## Release notes

## :new: Publish a GitHub Pull Request comment on documentation content change (with no structural changes)
- üó®Ô∏èüîó When Bump.sh `diff` action is configured in your repository workflow file, we will now publish a comment if your API document file has changes without structural changes. We used to publish a comment only on structural changes, but we now also publish a comment on content-only change too (which includes a preview link to that updated document).

The release also includes some dependencies upgrades.

Have fun documenting APIs ‚ú®
