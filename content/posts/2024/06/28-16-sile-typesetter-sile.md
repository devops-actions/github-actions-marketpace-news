## Release notes

### Summary of Improvements

The dust finally settled on the big [v0.15.0][] release. This patch does include a few more build system touch ups affecting the source tarball that made in require automake when it didn't really need it. But the impetus for this release is actually new features and typesetter bug fixes.

On the language front, @jodros has jumped in with some more domain expertise and Portuguese should now fully support hyphenation of Brazilian locale specific patterns. Additionally we fixed two bugs in the localization system. The locale set for Fluent localizations now properly tracks the document language at any given moment whether set by a font or even a Latin interjection in a bibliography.

Speaking of bibliographies, @Omikhleia is in the middle of a deep overhaul of our bibliography handling. This release has a number of features and bug fixes that lay some groundwork for better parsing and handling bibtex files. More fixes and features are also in progress and even ready for testing. If you have any interest in bibliographies feel free to review ongoing issues and PRs in the [bibliography cleanup project][bibliography].
