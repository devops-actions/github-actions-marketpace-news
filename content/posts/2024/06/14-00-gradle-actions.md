## Release notes

This release improves the integration with Gradle DevelocityÂ®, as well as updating a number of key dependencies.

- The new `develocity-access-key` input parameter allows the action to generate a short-lived access token for subsequent
  communication with Develocity. This reduces the risk of the full (long-lived) access key being compromised, 
  either accidentally or by a malicious action.
- New input parameters are available to configure Develocity injection. Previously Develocity injection could only be 
   enabled by setting environment variables.
- Checksums for Gradle 8.8 are now included, so that no network request is required for `wrapper-validation` with Gradle 8.8 wrappers.
