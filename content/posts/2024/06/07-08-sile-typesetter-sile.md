## Release notes

### Summary of Improvements

In the works for over a year with over 500 commits and 100 issues closed, please welcome the biggest single release in SILE history. This is the big “Rewrite it in Rust”! *Caveat lector.* In truth this is a big release but it is **not** a rewrite. All the typesetting internals of SILE are still written in Lua and 100% user modifiable at runtime. From an end user or 3rd party module developer standpoint little has changed. However **SILE itself is now a compiled Rust application** that includes its own Lua interpreter. The build process can (optionally) embed all the Lua and other resources files that makeup SILE and its dependencies in a single binary. This opens the door for improvements such as being able to leverage Rust libraries (including exposing their functions to Lua), write some parts of core functions in Rust for performance or preference, write modules in languages other than Lua or C, package SILE for platforms where Lua is not easy to get running, and much more.

The language change mostly affects building and packaging SILE itself. Once running, relatively little has changed with the *way* SILE interacts with documents. That being said quite a number of default settings have been changed. See the *Usage* section of these release notes and the `retrograde` module documentation for tips on how to transition smoothly.

For a transition period, the Lua based CLI is still available as `sile-lua`. This may be useful for scripting environments that generate inputs and/or parse the output of SILE itself. These should be transitioned to the new Rust CLI `sile` which has a few minor differences in argument handling and output message formatting. The Lua CLI will only be available for a limited number of future releases. Please do report any issues using the new CLI.

Extra thanks to @Omikhleia for lots contributions and input during the development cycle; and also to @ctrlcctrlv for generous sponsorships that enabled me to commit quite a bit more time to development.

#### Installation: For Anyone Installing From Packages

If you install SILE from your distro's package manager or other packaging, nothing about your process needs to change. Update via your system tools and enjoy.

#### Installation: For Distro Packagers and Source Installations

If you install from source or package SILE, the build command sequence is the same but there are new prerequisite dependencies. It now requires Rust tooling (`cargo`, `rustc`) as well as some more utilities (`jq`) to be available at build time. No new dependencies are needed at run time. In fact it is now no longer necessary to use a Lua VM available at runtime for the new CLI. SILE brings its own Lua VM along. (The legacy `sile-lua` CLI of course still uses Lua as before.) Optionally the build process can also be setup to embed all of its runtime dependencies in a single binary. See `./configure --enable-embedded-resources` and `./configure --enable-static` if you want to pursue the single binary route. Most users should use the defaults that install the Lua files and other assets separately as an easy reference for tinkering with and overriding them.

Another notable change is that the default Lua VM has been switched from whatever the system supplied to to LuaJIT. This has been an option for a while, but the default has been whatever the newest PUC Lua version was on the host system. LuaJIT is roughly equivalent to Lua 5.1 and doesn't have some small niceties from 5.4, but it is much much faster. Some of the differences are papered over since SILE depends on and provides the *compat53* library compatibility layer. Of course build time SILE can still be configured to used any version of Lua of your choice. This can be used to match compatibility with 3rd party modules or other system components.

#### Usage

A number of command behaviours and default settings have been changed. This *will* likely cause documents to render with a different flow. It will also break support for some 3rd party modules which will need to be updated to match. Many (but not all) of the changes can be temporarily disabled to cause as few changes when rendering old documents as possible. A new module called `retrograde` can be loaded at run time that will reset defaults and even revert some commands and functions to their previous behavior. A target argument can be passed for the version of SILE your document was designed for. Any default setting changes and as much other functionality as practical that may have changed since that release will be reverted.

```console
$ sile -u 'packages.retrograde[target=v0.14.17]' <INPUTS>
```

Since the Lua VM version used by default is different, you may need to reinstall 3rd party modules with a matching Lua version. You can first query SILE to understand what version of Lua it is using. With that information you can specify the Lua version you want when you install modules as LuaRocks to match. As a demonstration we'll install a Markdown input module in a project-local directory where SILE will find it without extra path configuration, then use it to render a PDF file:

```console
$ sile -q -e 'print(SILE.lua_version); os.exit()'
5.1
$ luarocks --lua-version 5.1 --tree lua_modules install markdown.sile
[…]
$ echo 'Test *Markdown* rendering.' > test.md
$ sile -u inputters.markdown test.md
[…]
```

Without further ado, here is the nitty–gritty.


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **packages:** Lists now respect the input document spacing and normal settings with regard to paragraphs breaks before, after, and inside lists. This is place of overriding the paragraph skip settings to match the list item spacing setting and always forcing paragraph breaks before and after lists.

* **classes:** Hitherto SILE has cleared the current.parindent setting as soon as it used it at the beginning of a paragraph. With this release, the setting is not being cleared until a paragraph is explicitly ended. This will not have an affect on many documents, but could completely blow up layout code that implicitly relied on the effect. Normal paragraphs (e.g. separated by a blank line in the input) and any use cases that explicitly called far ending a paragraph (e.g. by calling `\par`) will be unaffected. But anywhere a paragraph break was simulated by adding vertical space, the indentation will not be applied the next start of a line. This means that calling any variant of `\skip` inline in a paragraph will result in content beginning on a new line without using the parindent setting.

    Fixing this change in behaviour requires either explicitly resetting the current.parindent setting *after* it is initially used or explicitly ending a paragraph before or after placing a vertical skip.

* **inputters:** Input documents using the SIL language will now retain whitespace more consistently. Whitespace following environment blocks is no longer swallowed in differently than space following command syntax. Consecutive line breaks in the input will consistently trigger new paragraphs no matter what they follow.

    Note that this change cannot be patched over via the retrograde package settings because by the time your document could specify what packages to load or settings to set, the input document has already been parsed. To achieve the same rendering results where environments could be ended leaving any amount of blank lines and still joined to the following content as part of the same paragraphs, you will need to remove the extraneous whitespace.

* **core:** Several top level instance creators of various names have been re-organized under SILE.types.

    Specifically SILE.color, SILE.measurement, and SILE.length have the same names, just under SILE.types.<name>. Additionally SILE.nodefactory is now SILE.types.node and SILE.units is not SILE.types.unit.

    This brings a little bit of sanity to the naming schemes so that you can guess how to use something from the name, but it also makes room for 3rd party add ons to more easily extend or replace these functions. It also makes it easier to start substituting Rust bits where desired.

* **core:** Use SILE.papersize() instead of SILE.paperSizeParser()

* **classes:** The "center", "raggedleft" and "raggedright" environments formerly reset the margins (left or right skips), meaning they'd take the full frame width. They all cancelled the paragraph indent. The new behaviour honors the fixed part of the parent context's margins, meaning that if you have an environment playing with margins such as an epigraph or an indented quote, those margins are not lost. The raggedleft and raggedright environment also now no longer cancel the paragraph indent.

* **classes:** The \script function was heavily overloaded to have many different functions at once and more targeted tools were introduced in SILE v0.14.0 To load 3rd party modules designed for use with SILE, use \use[module=...] instead of \script[src=...]. To run arbitrary Lua code inline use \lua{}; Lua code may be provided inline or externally via either a require= option to load a regular (non-SILE) Lua module using the Lua module path or src= option to load a file by file path.

* **core:** For ... reasons ... the default width of spaces in SILE has been a highly opinionated and non-standard 1.2 spaces. While it can be argued that this makes some fonts and some documents look better, it is a very strange thing to have as a global default. Unfortunately setting it back to a more conventional 1 space is a major change and will cause many/most documents to re–flow.

    The old default can be recovered either in documents with:

    ```sile
    \set[parameter=shaper.spaceenlargementfactor,value=1.2,makedefault=true]
    ```

    ...or even from the CLI when rendering a document:

    ```console
    $ sile -e 'SILE.settings:set("shaper.spaceenlargementfactor", 1.2, true)'
    ```

* **core:** The previous default paragraph indent was hard coded with a point size (20pt) that did not adapt will to different fonts or page layouts. The new default uses a relative unit that will adjust based on the leading (1bs). This will cause most documents to re–flow. To keep them the same the setting may be reset to the old default either in the document:

    ```sile
    \set[parameter=document.parindent,value=20pt,makedefault=true]
    ```

    ...or even from the CLI when rendering a document:

    ```console
    $ sile -e 'SILE.settings:set("document.parindent", "20pt", true)'
    ```

* **utilities:** For modules that rely on `SILE.utilities` (`SU`), and in particular raw content handling functions `subContent()`, `walkContent()`, `stripContentPos()`, `hasContent()`, and `contentToString()`, these and similar functions have been moved into `SILE.utilities.ast` (`SU.ast`). The `subContent()` implementation also no longer adds id="stuff" attributes to everything.

* **packages:** The default rendering of Ruby readings has changed from just using a bold weight to using the OpenType +ruby feature. Fonts that support this should work with no change, but documents rendered in fonts that do not support it will need to set the `ruby.opentype` feature to `false` to get the same rendering method as before.

* **classes:** The former implementation of the "em" command did not support nesting and was just setting the font style to italic. The command now alternates italic and regular when nested. * **packages:** The current (pseudo) idempotent behaviour when loading a package potentially clobbers anything that has been modified since the last load. Loading a package, then modifying a function it provides, then loading the same package again will clobber the modification. This is good for idempotency but not very good for user experience when you may not be modifying all aspects of a document render pipeline at once, as in when using templates.

    This change makes the default behaviour to run setting, raw handler, and command registrations only once. An alternative to :loadpackage() called :reloadpackage() can be used to force all these registrations to be rerun when the goal is to make sure of a specific state.

* **classes:** Remove obsolete/broken native markdown class

* **core:** The internal package manager that installed stuff to the system from inside SILE was deprecated back in v0.13.2. It is now completely removed. External 3rd party packages are fully supported using LuaRocks and are much more robust.
