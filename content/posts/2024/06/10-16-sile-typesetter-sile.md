## Release notes

### Summary of Improvements

The big [v0.15.0 release][v0.15.0] had some rough edges. But we mentioned that in the [v0.15.1 release notes][v0.15.1] already. The truth is we fumbled some of the sources in the source tarball again. Here is to being able to build cleanly from the source tarball again.

### Bug Fixes

* **build:** Bundle all assets in source distribution ([5198641](https://github.com/sile-typesetter/sile/commit/5198641080d929a9240853e8322bf4ba36104cd9))
