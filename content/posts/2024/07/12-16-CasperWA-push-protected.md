## Release notes

# Use Python 3.11 throughout

Update and conform the code base and all development-related code (CI/CD workflows and more) to expect a Python 3.11 interpreter.

## Conform more to standard GitHub Actions behavior

Extend the default for acceptable conclusions (the `acceptable_conclusions` input) for the action to exit in a successful state to include the `skipped` conclusion. It previously only included the `success` conclusion. Thanks to @MattiSG for this extension.
