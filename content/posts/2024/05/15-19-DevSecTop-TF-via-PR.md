  - Requires `checks: write` permission.
- Copy TF output to the job summary for easier access within GitHub Actions > Jobs.

### Changed

- (meta) Dependabot configuration to keep Terraform dependencies up-to-date [in a group](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/2178#issuecomment-2111007962) (until [OpenTofu catches up](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/1236)).
- (meta) Formatted yml â†’ yaml workflows for consistency and legibility.

### Security

- Explicitly list all 3 GitHub Actions used by this workflow and the [steps taken](https://github.com/DevSecTop/TF-via-PR/blob/main/SECURITY.md) to prevent supply chain attacks from upstream dependencies:
  1. [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache)
  1. [actions/github-script](https://github.com/actions/github-script)
  1. [actions/upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact)
