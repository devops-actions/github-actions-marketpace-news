## Release notes

Since `paramCase` and `headerCase` were deprecated from the `change-case` npm package, new cases were added to provide these options:

- `paramCase` is now replaced by `kebabCase`

- `headerCase` is now replaced by `trainCase`

Both parameters are currently available, but `paramCase` and `headerCase` may be deprecated in the future.
