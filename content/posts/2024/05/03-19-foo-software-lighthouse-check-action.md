Version updated for **foo-software/lighthouse-check-action** to version **v12.0.1**.
- This action is used across all versions by **820** repositories.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/lighthouse-check) to find the latest changes.

## Release notes

The `configFile` input was removed in the `@foo-software/lighthouse-check` dependency in a previous release and unfortunately we neglected removing this input from the GitHub Action, hence doing that here.
