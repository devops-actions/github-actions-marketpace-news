## Release notes

Changes in this release:

* Fixed issue #3. The default value of `dry_run` is now `false`, as it was supposed to be.
* Removed the `save_errors` parameter; it doesn't seem useful for Waystation and just adds complexity.
* Updated and improved the documentation, and added screenshots.
* Revised and improved the sample workflow.
* Added a file (`sample-workflow.yml`) for the sample workflow, to make copying easier.
* Updated source code file headers to be more streamlined and include a missing copyright statement.
* Updated the copyright year in the relevant files.
