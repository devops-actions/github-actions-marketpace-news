Version updated for **PraiseXI/AntiSpamPRLabeler** to version **v1.2.0**.
- This action is used across all versions by **1** repositories.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/antispam-pr-labeler-and-commenter) to find the latest changes.

## Release notes

changed functionality to only check each pr that is opened instead of scanning all PRs.
Restructured files.
Fixed bug that was not allowing commenting.
I also included files that you can run to help you simulate spammy prs to test the action on your own test repo, as well as a script to clean up those simulated prs that were generated.
