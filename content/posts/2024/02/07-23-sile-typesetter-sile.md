## Release notes

### Summary of Improvements

The "big v0.15" is still brewing, but we keep coming up with little improvements that easily fit in the v0.14 series. It turns out the special hyphenation handling we added to Polish (for explicitly hyphenated words) is used by quite a few languages. At this time we've applied it by default to Croatian, Czech, Portuguese, Slovak. and Spanish. Thanks to @Omikhleia for much of the research on this as well as @jodros, @DavidLRowe, @jakubkaczor, and @tomas-vl for domain expertise.

Additionally Jo√£o contributed an option for columns command to more easily set up column frames with balancing turned on or off.
