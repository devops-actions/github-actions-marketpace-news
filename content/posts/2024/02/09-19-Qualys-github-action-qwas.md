## Release notes

Qualys GitHub Actions for WAS provides you with the following features:

GitHub Action for WAS allows DevOps teams to build Web application vulnerability scans into their existing GitHub workflows.

By integrating and automating scans, web application security testing is accomplished early in the SDLC to catch and eliminate security flaws before they reach production.

With a valid Qualys WAS account and API access, you can configure the action to fail the build if certain criteria are met such as the presence of specific severity for example severity 4 or 5.

Furthermore, scan results are readily available as JSON artifacts and they can be downloaded from GitHub.
