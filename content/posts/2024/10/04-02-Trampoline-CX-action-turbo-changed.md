## Release notes

## ðŸš€ New Features 

- [BREAKING] Support for Turborepo V2! This version supports both v1 and v2 of Turborepo. If you have `turbo` installed as a dependency of your root `package.json`, no need to do anything, the action will know which version of Turbo to use. Otherwise, ensure to pass the `turbo-major-version` option to the action.
