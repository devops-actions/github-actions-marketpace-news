## Release notes

### Changed

- Quick Start:
  - Diff/KiRi: Avoid creating when we don't have at least 2 to compare
- PCB Print:
  - Avoid `colored_pads` and `colored_vias` side effects (#682)
- BoM:
  - Avoid leaking DIGIKEY_CLIENT_ID and DIGIKEY_CLIENT_SECRET in logs

### Added

- Experimental GUI
- Preflights:
  - Draw Fancy Stackup: which includes the type of vias used (#699)
  - Include Table: used to include CSV tables generated by bom/position
    outputs (#702)
- Globals:
  - `dnp_cross_top_layer` and `dnp_cross_bottom_layer`: to control the layer
    where footprints are crossed. (#700 and #622)
- SVG: `use_aux_axis_as_origin` option (#681)
- Report: thickness units (#685)
- PCB Print:
  - Worksheet: undocumented font face and color now can be used (See #695)
- Panelize:
  - `copy_vias_on_mask` option to workaround KiCad's bug 18991 (See #703 and
    #704)

### Fixed

- BoM: Sub-PCBs not applied (#697)
- Copy Files: problems when using from compress and using worksheets.
- Export Project: problems when downloading KiCad models and trying to compress
  the result.
- PcbDraw: problems with 0 ohms THT resistors (#689)
- PCB Print:
  - Allow specifying `repeat_for_layer` with empty `repeat_layers`.
    This was the old behavior (i.e. 1.7.0) (#671)
  - Problems with drill marks on KiCad 8.0.4+, which prints them in every
    single layer (even technical ones) (#696)
  - When trying to force a WKS and the project didn't define a WKS.
    The "gui" strategy failed to use the specified WKS
- Draw stackup:
  - Segmentation Fault on KiCad 8 when creating a new group
  - Units not applied when creating a new group
- Expansion of internal field names. KiCad expands "VALUE", not "Value", which
  is what you see in the GUI
