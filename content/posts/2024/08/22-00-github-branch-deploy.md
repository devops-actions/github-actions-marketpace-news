## Release notes

## What's Changed

This release mainly contains one minor change to how a few Action inputs used. Some basic input validation is now applied to them, so if you provide an unexpected Action input, the workflow will now fail and log the correct options for the input for you to use instead.

* Input Validation by @GrantBirki in https://github.com/github/branch-deploy/pull/293
* Improve `.help` command by @GrantBirki in https://github.com/github/branch-deploy/pull/294
* Node Updates by @GrantBirki in https://github.com/github/branch-deploy/pull/295
