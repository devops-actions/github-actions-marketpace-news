## Release notes

### Gotta go fast ðŸ§—

`git-cliff-action` is now waaaaaaaay faster.

We switched to a classic bash script to download the `git-cliff` binary instead of a Docker action.
So, no more building images, it just downloads and runs. Vroooom! ðŸ’¨

Thanks @M0NsTeRRR for the implementation in https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff-action/pull/26

### Version input âœ¨

Also, you can now specify a `git-cliff` version to run:

```yml
- name: Generate a changelog
  uses: orhun/git-cliff-action@v4
  with:
    version: latest
    config: cliff.toml
    args: --verbose
```

The default is `v2.5.0` as of now, but you can also use `latest`.
