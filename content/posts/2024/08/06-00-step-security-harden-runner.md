## Release notes

## What's Changed
Release v2.9.1 by @h0x0er and @varunsh-coder in #440 
This release includes two changes:
1. Updated markdown displayed in the job summary by the Harden-Runner Action.
2. Fixed a bug affecting Enterprise Tier customers where the agent attempted to upload telemetry for jobs with disable-telemetry set to true. No telemetry was uploaded as the endpoint was not in the allowed list.
