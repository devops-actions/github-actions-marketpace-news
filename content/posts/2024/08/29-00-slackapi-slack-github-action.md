## Release notes

## What's changed

This release introduces an optional `payload-delimiter` parameter for flattening nested objects with a customized delimiter before the payload is sent to Slack Workflow Builder when using workflow webhook triggers.

```diff
  - name: Send a custom flattened payload
    uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1.27.0
+   with:
+     payload-delimiter: "_"
    env:
      SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```

Setting this value to an underscore (`_`) is recommended when using nested inputs within Workflow Builder to match expected input formats of Workflow Builder, but the actual value can be changed to something else! This "flattening" behavior **did** exist prior to this version, but used a period (`.`) which is not valid for webook inputs in Workflow Builder.

The resulting output of flattened objects is not always clear, but the following can hopefully serve as a quick reference as well as [these specs](https://github.com/slackapi/slack-github-action/blob/5d1fb07d3c4f410b8d278134c714edff31264beb/test/slack-send-test.js#L264-L319) when using `_` as the delimiter:

**Input**:

```json
{
    "apples": "tree",
    "bananas": {
        "truthiness": true
    }
}
```

**Output**:

```json
{
    "apples": "tree",
    "bananas_truthiness": "true"
}
```

Notice that `bananas_truthiness` is also stringified in this process, as part of updating values to match the expected inputs of Workflow Builder!
