## Release notes

This release adds support for expanding the `~` character to the user's home directory for the following inputs:

- `cache-local-path`
- `tool-dir`
- `tool-bin-dir`
- `cache-dependency-glob`

```yaml
- name: Expand the tilde character
  uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v3
  with:
    cache-local-path: "~/path/to/cache"
    tool-dir: "~/path/to/tool/dir"
    tool-bin-dir: "~/path/to/tool-bin/dir"
    cache-dependency-glob: "~/my-cache-buster"
```

In order to make this work `cache-dependency-glob` also got support to glob files outside the working directory:

```yaml
- name: Define an absolute cache dependency glob
  uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v3
  with:
    enable-cache: true
    cache-dependency-glob: "/tmp/my-folder/requirements*.txt"
```

Thank you @fynnsu for raising this issue!
