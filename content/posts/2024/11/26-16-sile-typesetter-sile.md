## Release notes

### Summary of Improvements

Please welcome CSL support. This is still a bit experimental, but this begins the deprecation of the home grown bibliography styling in our *bibtex* package. SILE can now leverage industry standard Citation Style Language specifications, which opens up a world of existing locale and style guide support. This is thanks to long-running work from from @Omikhleia on overhauling [bibliography][] support. His work on the *math* package also continues with many operator and layout fixes and a few new features continuing to round out out MathML compatibility.

For folks calling out to Lua functions or system tools in their classes, packages, or documents, those calls will now track the document locale. If you use an OS function or external tool that supports localization, you should now get results that match the locale in the document at the time it was called. Responsiveness to locale modifiers might be a little rough until we normalize our locale format to be BCP-47 compliant, but it already works for basic locales. Incidentally this also provides a utility API that can be used to set any ENV variable you want before running external tooling.

Of interest only to SILE developers, some new configure flags have been added for convenience. Any individual tool used in the development and release process can be skipped or overridden using standard `--with[out]-PACKAGE=PATH` flags. Additionally skipping *all* the tooling checks can be done with `--without-developer-tools` even when `--with-developer-mode` is used.

Finally for distribution packagers, cross compilation of the Rust binaries should be a bit easier now.

### New Features

* **build:** Add configure flag to skip checks for all developer tools ([c01c867](https://github.com/sile-typesetter/sile/commit/c01c867174a708e75a4bdb929eb8cac25b7a1048))
