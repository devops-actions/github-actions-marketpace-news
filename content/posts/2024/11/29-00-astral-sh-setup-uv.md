## Release notes

## Changes

You can now use the input `python-version` to set the environment variable `UV_PYTHON` for the rest of your workflow.
This will override any python version specifications in `pyproject.toml` and `.python-version`

```yaml
- name: Install the latest version of uv and set the python version to 3.12
  uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v4
  with:
    python-version: "3.12"
```

You can combine this with a matrix to test multiple python versions:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install the latest version of uv and set the python version
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - name: Test with python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        run: uv run --frozen pytest
```
