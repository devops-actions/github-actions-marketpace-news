## Release notes

This release adds support for scanning multi-arch container images.

To use this feature, specify the OS and CPU platform matching the image you wish to scan by adding the `platform` argument to your workflows, as shown below:

```yaml

      - name: Scan built image with Inspector
        uses: aws-actions/vulnerability-scan-github-action-for-amazon-inspector@v1
        id: inspector
        with:
          artifact_type: 'container'
          artifact_path: 'alpine:latest'
          ...
          platform: "linux/arm64/v8"
          sbomgen_version: "latest"
```

If platform is unspecified, this action will default to the OS/CPU platform that matches the GitHub Actions runner.

⚠️  This workflow requires inspector-sbomgen versions greater than or equal to 1.5.2.
