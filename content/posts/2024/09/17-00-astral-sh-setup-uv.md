## Release notes

## Changes

With this release `cache-dependency-glob` defaults to `**/uv.lock`.
This is in line with what most users would expect and also mirrors the default behaviors for setup-python which use  `**/requirements.txt`, `**/Pipfile.lock` or `**/poetry.lock`.

The previous default led to the cache being created only once and never invalidated or updated even when the dependencies changed.

This change only affects you if you are using `enable-cache: true` without specifying `cache-dependency-glob`. The only behavioral change you might see is one time cache miss.

Learn more about `cache-dependency-glob` in the [README section](https://github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv?tab=readme-ov-file#cache-dependency-glob).
