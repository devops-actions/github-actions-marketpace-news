## Release notes

<details>
  <summary>Rewrite action to typescript @goruha (#24)</summary>
  ## what
* Rewrite action from docker-backed to typescript 

## why
* Do not build a docker image to avoid hitting hub.docker.com
* Improve performance


## Migration `v0` to `v1`

There is an issue [The query contains `true` or `false` fails with an error](https://github.com/alexxander/jq-tools/issues/4). 
A workaround is to use a quote around `"true" and `"false" in a query.

To migrate from `v0` to `v1`, quote all `true` and `false` in your queries. 
Ex.:  `query: .true` replace with `query: ."true"`

Pay attention that substitutions in GitHub actions could also resolved as `true` or `false` and have to be quoted.

Ex.:  `query: .${{ inputs.from == '' }}` replace with `query: ."${{ inputs.from == '' }}"`
