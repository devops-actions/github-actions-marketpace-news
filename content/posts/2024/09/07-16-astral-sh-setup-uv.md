Version updated for **astral-sh/setup-uv** to version **v2.1.0**.
- This action is used across all versions by **204** repositories.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/python-setup-uv) to find the latest changes.

## Release notes

The default cacheLocalPath was `/tmp/setup-uv-cache` which led to undefined behavior on Windows runners. On Windows the default is now D:\a\_tmp\setup-uv-cache.

---

It is now also supported to supply a list of globs in `cache-dependency-glob`. This aligns with the functionality of `cache-dependency-path` in `actions/setup-python`

```yaml
- name: Define a list of cache dependency globs
  uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v1
  with:
    enable-cache: true
    cache-dependency-glob: |
      '**requirements*.txt'
      '**pyproject.toml'
```
