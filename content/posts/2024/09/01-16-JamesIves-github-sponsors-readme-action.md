## What's Changed
### New Features ðŸŽ‰
* feat: âœ¨ Adds ability to display anonymized private sponsors. Private sponsors will be displayed in the list, however any identifying information will be redacted. This can be useful if you want to display all sponsors, regardless of their privacy settings. To enable this feature, you can set `include-private` to `true` in your workflow.

* feat: âœ¨ Adds the ability to use `avatarUrl` in a sponsorship template. This is an exposed field from the GitHub API and typically matches `https://github.com/{username}.png` (unless `include-private` is set to `true` that is)
