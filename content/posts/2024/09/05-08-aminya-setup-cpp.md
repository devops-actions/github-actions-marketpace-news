## Release notes

## What's Changed
* ðŸŽ‰ fix: use the default/latest GCC version on Linux/macOS by @aminya in https://github.com/aminya/setup-cpp/pull/277  
	
	- As of this version, the latest available GCC on the default Linux repositories are installed by default. That means, the GCC versions installable via the test toolchain PPA are not installed on Ubuntu/Debian (unless the version is requested explicitly). This increases the compatibility of the binaries built via setup-cpp for distribution. 
	- On other platforms, the latest GCC version is installed by default. 

* ðŸŽ‰ feat: use GitHub API to match MinGW assets by @aminya in https://github.com/aminya/setup-cpp/pull/277 
	
	- Instead of manually maintaining the available releases, now the GitHub API is used to find the MinGW assets. This method will be used for LLVM in future releases.
