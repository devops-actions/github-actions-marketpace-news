## Release notes

## Changes

We got a frist contribution from @pollenjp!

Thanks to this we are now resolving the latest version and try to find it in the local cache instead of always downloading the latest release from the uv repository.
This new approach is not only more **efficient**, it also fixes a latent bug in the self-hosted runners tools cache and makes the code more **maintainable**.

Thank you @pollenjp!
