## Release notes

# Official SDF Github Action

<img src="https://cdn.sdf.com/img/sdf-logo.png">

This is the official SDF Labs sponsored Github action. This action enables simple integration of SDF compilation, testing, and deployment in to CI/CD. 

SDFâ€™s static analyis can supercharge CI/CD workflows for data teams. By compiling your SQL on each pull request, SDF can statically ensure new updates to your models are valid SQL and do not break anything downstream. Additionally, SDF supports the use of checks  in CI/CD. This feature allows users to define their own static tests, further enhancing the robustness and reliability of your data models. Unlike other CI/CD data tools, SDF checks everything statically, preventing you from having to incur compute costs to validate SQL and run impact analysis.

For more documentation on how to utilize this, see our official [CI/CD docs](https://docs.sdf.com/integrations/ci_cd).
