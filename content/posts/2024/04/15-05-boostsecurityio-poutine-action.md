## Release notes

Created by [BoostSecurity.io](https://boostsecurity.io/), poutine is a security scanner that detects misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in the build pipelines of a repository. It supports parsing CI workflows from GitHub Actions and Gitlab CI/CD. When given an access token with read-level access, poutine can analyze all the repositories of an organization to quickly gain insights into the security posture of the organization's software supply chain.
