Version updated for **sassdawe/pnp-sharing-settings-action** to version **version2**.
- This action is used across all versions by **?** repositories.

Go to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pnp-powershell-sharing-settings-as-code) to find the latest changes.

## Release notes

Version to is an "upgrade" to Composite action, which means now all three platforms are supported for the runners, not just Windows.

This version2 also shipped with the PnP.PowerShell v2.4.0 module packaged, so it executes faster as there is no online module installation.
