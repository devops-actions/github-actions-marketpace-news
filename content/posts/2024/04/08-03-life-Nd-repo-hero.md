## Release notes

## Release 1.0.0 - Initial Release

This is the first official release of Repo Hero, an innovative GitHub Action aimed at revolutionizing repository exploration. Repo Hero builds upon the foundation of the original Repo Visualizer, offering enhanced capabilities to developers seeking deeper insights into their codebases.

### Key Features:
- **`SVG Code Visualization`:** Generate clear and informative SVG diagrams representing your repository's structure.
- **`Detailed File Information (NEW)`:** Create a JSON file containing paths and sizes of all files in your repository, enabling comprehensive analysis.
- **`Customization Options`:** Tailor the appearance of the diagrams with excluded paths, globs, colors, and root directory selection.
- **`Flexible Output`:** Choose between creating a new commit with the diagram, downloading it as an artifact, or accessing the SVG data directly within your workflow.

### Why Use Repo Hero?
- **`Optimize API Calls`:** Avoid unnecessary GitHub API calls by having file size information readily available, especially beneficial for exploring large repositories.
- **`Gain Deeper Insights`:** Analyze file size distribution within your project to identify areas for potential optimization or refactoring.

This initial release marks the beginning of a new era in repository visualization and exploration. Give Repo Hero a try and unlock the full potential of your codebase!
