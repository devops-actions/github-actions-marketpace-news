## Release notes

> # Important note about versioning
>
> **In this release, GitHub have changed to an auto-tagging model, where the release will be made as `vX.Y.Z` and an automatic tag is created called `vX`, so there will be no more proxy releases for the latest version number - just use `v4` from now on!**
