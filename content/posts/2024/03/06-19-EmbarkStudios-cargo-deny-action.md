## Release notes

### Fixed
- [PR#626](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/626) resolved [#625](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/625) by explicitly checking that a license identified as Pixar was actually (probably) the Pixar license, instead of a normal Apache-2.0 license.
