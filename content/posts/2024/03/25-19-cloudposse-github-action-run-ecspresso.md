## Release notes

<details>
  <summary>Partial Task Definition Support @Benbentwo (#15)</summary>

  ## what
* Application repositories can now run DB Migrations and other Ecspresso tasks while only having a partial task definition in their repository. e.g.
```json
{
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "app",
      "image": "{{ must_env `IMAGE` }}"
    }
  ],
  "cpu": "256",
  "memory": "1024"
}
```

The rest can be fetched from S3, which will be merged. This S3 Task Template is populated by our [ECS Service component](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/tree/main/modules/ecs-service) with the variable `s3_mirror_name` which enables [these modules](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/blob/main/modules/ecs-service/main.tf#L555-L585)

This action will then merge the task definition before running ecspresso commands.

## why
* We want the infrastructure repo to control the infrastructure things of the application deployment process, such as volumes (getting the ID is better through terraform than hardcoding). But we want the application (GitHub Repo) to decide the image, CPU, env or any other application related change.
