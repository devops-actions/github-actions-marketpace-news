## Release notes

## What's Changed

* feat: âœ¨  support active-only input by @JamesIves in https://github.com/JamesIves/github-sponsors-readme-action/pull/737 - This feature allows you to show sponsors regardless of their sponsorship status. This is useful in scenarios where you want to show all sponsors who have previously donated, and not just those who hold an active subscription. To use this, you can set `active-only: false` within the `with` parameters of the action. It will default to `true`, which is the current behavior of the action.
